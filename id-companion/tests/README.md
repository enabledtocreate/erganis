# ID Companion tests

Unit and in-repo integration tests for the mobile app.

- **app/tests/** or co-located `app/**/*.test.*` — App/screen tests
- **shared/tests/** — Shared logic and API client tests

Use the standard test runner for your stack (e.g. Jest for React Native, Flutter test).  
Cross-repo integration and E2E tests live in the **parent** repo: `erganis/tests/integration/` and `erganis/tests/e2e/`.

See [docs/TESTING.md](../../docs/TESTING.md) in the parent repo.
