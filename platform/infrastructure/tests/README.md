# Infrastructure tests

Tests for runtime and deployment (e.g. Docker image build, compose up, deployment scripts).

Data-layer tests (DAL, migrations, SQL) live in **`../data/tests/`**.

Cross-repo integration lives in the **parent** repo: `erganis/tests/integration/`.  
See [docs/TESTING.md](../../../docs/TESTING.md) in the parent repo.
